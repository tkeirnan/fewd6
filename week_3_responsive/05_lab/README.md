# Super Awesome Happy Funtime HTML/CSS Lab

This lab is challenging, but we'll work on a plan together as a class to divide the work into tasks and decide what parts we'd like to complete.  Additionally, for homework we'll pick some features we didn't implement in class and you can try and complete them on your own.  You are not expected to recreate every aspect of the website, so let's see what we can do and have fun!

##Booking & Prints

###Weddings

For $1 Million Ryan will shoot your wedding. That rate might seem high, but you probably don't realize what a pain it is to shoot a wedding.

###Headshots

If you're Ryan's friend, he'll do your headshot. Or if you're a friend of a friend. Or a friend of a friend of a friend.

###Concerts

If Ryan likes your music, and happens to show up with his camera, he'll take pictures. Otherwise wedding rates apply.

###Everything Else

Ryan shoots whatever he likes, and if you don't like it then he doesn't care. If that sounds good to you then...
